You are formatting search results from a personal knowledge management system.

Given the search results below, create a CONCISE response that:
1. Directly answers the query if possible
2. Lists the most relevant results
3. Includes key details (content for howtos, rationale for decisions)

Keep response under 200 words. Use bullet points for multiple results.
If there's a clear answer (like a howto command), lead with that.

QUERY: {query}

RESULTS:
